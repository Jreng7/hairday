# Hair Day Project

**Hair Day** is a project developed with a focus on learning and practical application of **JavaScript**.

It is an interactive and functional application designed for managing salon appointments. The main idea is to offer a simple and efficient solution for clients and professionals to organize their schedules.

## **🚀 Features**
- **🗓️ Service Booking:** Allows the client to select available services and times.
- **🔄 Dynamic Listing:** Displays available times and offered services, updated in real-time.
- **✅ Data Validation:** Ensures the user fills in the necessary fields correctly.
- **🎯 Interactivity:** Uses DOM events and element manipulation to create a smooth user experience.

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**
- **HTML5:** Application structure.
- **CSS3:** Styling for a pleasant and modern interface.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Application logic, DOM manipulation, and user interaction.

## **📚 Course Information**
This project is part of the **"Full Stack" course** on the Rocketseat platform.  
Due to **copyright restrictions**, I cannot provide access to the **Figma** design files.

**Hair Day** was a perfect opportunity to strengthen my knowledge of pure JavaScript, explore good coding practices, and understand the principles of interactivity in web development.
